In the analysis we'll use the ToothGrowth dataset:
```{r message = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data("ToothGrowth")
tooth <- tbl_df(ToothGrowth)
```

Some quick summary statistics of the dataset:
```{r}
summary(tooth)
glimpse(tooth)
```

Some exploratory graphs of the dataset:
```{r}
ggplot(tooth, aes(len)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 4)
ggplot(tooth, aes(supp, len, factor(dose))) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(. ~ dose)
```

The histogram shows the distribution of tooth length. We can see that it's mostly in the range of `r min(tooth$len)` to `r max(tooth$len)`, with median of `r median(tooth$len)`.
